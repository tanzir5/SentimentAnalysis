if reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum|66241

in a big corner office in hell|184877
in a summer overrun with movies dominated by cgi aliens and super heroes|66348
in a way , the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that allow it in .|25677
in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs. sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .|224009
in addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .|146289
in his u . s . debut , mr . schnitzler proves himself a deft pace master and stylist .|66359
in his latest effort , storytelling , solondz has finally made a movie that is n't just offensive -- it also happens to be good .|106698
in its dry and forceful way , it delivers the same message as jiri menzel 's closely watched trains and danis tanovic 's no man 's land .|45659
in my opinion , analyze that is not as funny or entertaining as analyze this , but it is a respectable sequel|106705
in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works .|184895
in the director 's cut , the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes .|106708
in the disturbingly involving family dysfunctional drama how i killed my father , french director anne fontaine delivers an inspired portrait of male-ridden angst and the emotional blockage that accompanies this human condition|45661
in the end , ted bundy 's only justification is the director 's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there 's no larger point , and little social context|146310

in the process of trimming the movie to an expeditious 84 minutes|146316
in the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar .|106718
indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is deuces wild .|106733
indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie .|146328
innocuous enough to make even jean-claude van damme look good .|106739
inside the film 's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it 's not that , it 's the tension that keeps you in your seat .|25689
instead , he shows them the respect they are due .|224063
instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid , we get an ugly , mean-spirited lashing out by an adult who 's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many barney videos .|106750
instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral , schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view .|66408

it 's a brilliant , honest performance by nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic kathy bates turns up . bravado kathy !|185012
it 's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but|146404
it 's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really does n't fit the part .|146413
it 's a great deal of sizzle and very little steak .|14156
it 's a great deal of sizzle and very little steak . but|40979
it 's a great deal of sizzle and very little steak . but what spectacular sizzle it is ! ... in this incarnation its fizz is infectious|40980
it 's a great performance and a reminder of dickens ' grandeur|66481
it 's a loathsome movie , it really is and|146420
it 's a lovely , eerie film that casts an odd , rapt spell .|66484
it 's a movie forged in the fires of chick flick hell .|146423
it 's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing ca n't possibly be enough .|66487
it 's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out ` amateur ' in almost every frame .|146424
it 's a smartly directed , grown-up film of ideas .|66505
it 's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it 's only acting .|224134
it 's a testament to the film 's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining , despite playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries .|224136
it 's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary .|146432
it 's about issues most adults have to face in marriage|106824
it 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick|185045
it 's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you 're more than six years old .|146437
it 's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are ` edgy|224148
it 's an 88-minute highlight reel that 's 86 minutes too long .|106833
it 's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director 's previous full frontal .|25741
it 's basically an overlong episode of tales from the crypt .|146453
it 's been 20 years since 48 hrs . made eddie murphy a movie star and the man has n't aged a day .|185075
it 's better suited for the history or biography channel|185079
it 's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes .|146466
it 's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate .|185091
it 's definitely an improvement on the first blade , since it does n't take itself so deadly seriously .|66550
it 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter ,|185096
it 's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational ,|146475

it 's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .|185117

it 's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie .|185119
it 's hard to pity the ` plain ' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss . rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash .|185121
it 's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but notorious c . h . o . still feels like a promising work-in-progress|185125
it 's in the action scenes that things fall apart .|185133
it 's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery|146514
it 's just a movie that happens to have jackie chan in it .|224191
it 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .|146522
it 's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there|146524
it 's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and|185140
it 's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and|66573
it 's like a `` big chill '' reunion of the baader-meinhof gang , only these guys are more harmless pranksters than political activists .|224197
it 's like an old warner bros . costumer jived with sex -- this could be the movie errol flynn always wanted to make , though bette davis , cast as joan , would have killed him|106897
it 's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert|146537
it 's never laugh-out-loud funny , but it is frequently amusing|106909
it 's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie , but it 's entertaining enough and worth a look .|66600
it 's not a particularly good film ,|185163
it 's not going to be everyone 's bag of popcorn|66602
it 's not hateful . it 's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical .|106927
it 's not just a feel-good movie , it 's a feel movie . you feel good , you feel sad , you feel pissed off|66613
it 's not like having a real film of nijinsky ,|66619
it 's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but|106930
it 's not particularly well made , but|106936
it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't .|146568
it 's not too fast and not too slow .|224220
it 's obvious ( je-gyu is ) trying for poetry|185183
it 's obvious ( je-gyu is ) trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom|185185
it 's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up . the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .|146602
it 's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth|41002
it 's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth .|25761
it 's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period|66645
it 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .|185196
it 's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process|66648
it 's rare for any movie to be as subtle and touching as the son 's room .|66650
it 's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline|185198
it 's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from `` promising '' to `` interesting '' to `` familiar '' before landing squarely on `` stupid '' .|224235
it 's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x ... look positively shakesperean by comparison .|185208
it 's so good that its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even oliver parker 's movie adaptation .|224238
it 's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just ca n't get no satisfaction .|146618
it 's still adam sandler , and it 's not little nicky . and for many of us , that 's good enough|66662
it 's such a mechanical endeavor ( that ) it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it .|106960
it 's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction .|185220
it 's sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful .|106961
it 's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied .|224251
it 's technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive .|66671
it 's the type of film about growing up that we do n't see often enough these days : realistic , urgent , and|66680
it 's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that 's been given the drive of a narrative and that 's been acted out -- the believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work .|224263
it 's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic .|146631
it 's touching and tender and proves that even in sorrow you can find humor .|224264
it 's tough to watch , but it 's a fantastic movie .|45764
it 's traditional moviemaking all the way , but it 's done with a lot of careful period attention as well as some very welcome wit .|14168
it 's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but|45768
it 's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but olympia , wash . , based filmmakers anne de marcken and marilyn freeman did just that and it 's what makes their project so interesting|45769
it 's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but olympia , wash. , based filmmakers anne de marcken and marilyn freeman did just that and it 's what makes their project so interesting|224267
it appears as if even the filmmakers did n't know what kind of movie they were making .|185248
it asks nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up .|66699
it ca n't escape its past , and it does n't want to|224272
it ca n't escape its past , and it does n't want to .|224273
it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time|185268
it does n't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality .|146659
it does n't make for great cinema|106992
it excels because , unlike so many other hollywood movies of its ilk , it offers hope .|66710
it extends a warm invitation into an unfamiliar world , then illuminates it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in unobtrusively .|25778
it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play : even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original .|146676
it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects|146677
it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers .|107001
it follows the blair witch formula for an hour , in which we 're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes .|185281
it has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past .|185284
it has fun with the quirks of family life , but it also treats the subject with fondness and respect .|224308
it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline .|185285
it has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing .|45790
it has plenty of laughs . it just does n't have much else ... especially in a moral sense .|107006
it haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away . ah yes , and then|45801
it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie ... but|224324
it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie ... but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving .|146699
it is about irrational , unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity .|224332
it is an indelible epic american story about two families , one black and one white , facing change in both their inner and outer lives .|66733
it is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients .|66735
it is life affirming and heartbreaking , sweet without the decay factor , funny and sad .|107014
it is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd .|107015
it is most of the things costner movies are known for|146703
it is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it .|146706
it is ridiculous , of course ... but it is also refreshing , disarming , and just outright enjoyable despite its ridiculousness .|25794
it is risky , intelligent , romantic and rapturous from start to finish .|25795
it is sentimental but feels free to offend , is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters , is about grief and yet permits laughter .|45819
it is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness .|107020
it is up to you to decide if you need to see it .|66740
it made me want to get made-up and go see this movie with my sisters .|45822
it may as well be called '' jar-jar binks|185315
it may even fall into the category of films you love to hate .|224364
it may not be a huge cut of above the rest , but i enjoyed barbershop . it 's a funny little movie with clever dialogue and likeable characters .|107042
it may not be as cutting , as witty or as true as back in the glory days of weekend and two or three things i know about her , but who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved in the process ?|224368
it may not be particularly innovative ,|107044
it may sound like a mere disease-of - the-week tv movie , but a song for martin is made infinitely more wrenching by the performances of real-life spouses seldahl and wollter .|66759
it might as well have been problem child|146730
it might be ` easier ' to watch on video at home|66760
it might be tempting to regard mr. andrew and his collaborators as oddballs|224376
it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting .|224384
it really is a shame that more wo n't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet ` evelyn . '|224387
it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it|185333
it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it .|185334
it risks seeming slow and pretentious , because it thinks the gamble is worth the promise .|25801
it shares the first two films ' loose-jointed structure|185335
it squanders chan 's uniqueness ; it could even be said to squander jennifer love hewitt|224390
it squanders chan 's uniqueness ; it could even be said to squander jennifer love hewitt !|224391
it takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected ,|146745
it takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but|146747
it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , '' look at this ! this is an interesting movie !|107069
it uses an old-time formula , it 's not terribly original and it 's rather messy -- but|41029
it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy .|146761
it wears its heart on the sleeve of its gaudy hawaiian shirt|107076
it will come as no surprise that the movie is n't scary .|146762
it will guarantee to have you leaving the theater with a smile on your face .|107078
it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans|146768
it wo n't bust your gut -- and it 's not intended to -- it 's merely a blandly cinematic surgical examination of what makes a joke a joke|41032
it wo n't harm anyone , but neither can i think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it|224401
it wo n't hold up over the long haul , but in the moment , finch 's tale provides the forgettable pleasures of a saturday matinee|66787
it would work much better as a one-hour tv documentary .|146778
it wraps up a classic mother\/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it 's not all new , at least it looks pretty|107088
its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider 's performance is so fine , it 's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess .|185378
its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy .|185386
its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche .|185390
its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions|146790
its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time .|19015
its story about a young chinese woman , ah na , who has come to new york city to replace past tragedy with the american dream is one that any art-house moviegoer is likely to find compelling .|107105
its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question|146799
its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters|107116
ja rule and kurupt should have gotten to rap .|146806
jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth ca n't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting|66854
jacquot 's strategy allows his cast the benefit of being able to give full performances ... while demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself .|45861

jason x is this bad on purpose is never clear . but one thing 's for sure|185450
jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects|185451

joan 's wacky decision to stand by her man , no matter how many times he demonstrates that he 's a disloyal satyr|146882
john leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie .|146902
john mctiernan 's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison 's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga .|224473
john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us `` the skulls ''|224474
john q. is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause .|224477

kissing jessica stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again .|67040
kung pow is oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .|147042
kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk|185641
kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business .|185647
labute ca n't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he 's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel 's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film .|107367

lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child 's interest and an adult 's patience . but it also has many of the things that made the first one charming .|67104
lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago|185669
laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it 's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters .|147063
land beyond time is an enjoyable big movie primarily because australia is a weirdly beautiful place .|45988
large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year 's radar screen that it 's tempting just to go with it for the ride .|224563

ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design|185720

the modern-day royals have nothing on these guys when it comes to scandals .|47158
the most compelling performance of the year|69715
the most consistently funny of the austin powers films .|109972
the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute|149558
the most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle 's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration .|226337
the most remarkable ( and frustrating ) thing about world traveler|188365
the most remarkable ( and frustrating ) thing about world traveler , which opens today in manhattan|188367
the movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though ,|188387
the movie 's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .|188392
the movie 's seams may show ... but pellington gives `` mothman '' an irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling .|226350
the movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster\/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and|109990
the movie has a soft , percolating magic , a deadpan suspense .|19314
the movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers .|188420
the movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but|69734
the movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people .|69736
the movie is a lumbering load of hokum but ...|149598
the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .|188427
the movie is as padded as allen 's jelly belly .|109994
the movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn ,|188429
the movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious|109998
the movie is n't always easy to look at . but if it is indeed a duty of art to reflect life , than leigh has created a masterful piece of artistry right here .|26868
the movie is n't just hilarious :|47176
the movie is n't painfully bad , something to be ` fully experienced ' ; it 's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten .|188440
the movie is not as terrible as the synergistic impulse that created it .|69747
the movie is our story as much as it is schmidt 's , no matter if it 's viewed as a self-reflection or cautionary tale .|69748
the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it .|110006
the movie is virtually without context --|149612
the movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time .|149615
the movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it 's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge|226381
the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable . i tried to read the time on my watch .|149618
the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his .|188453
the movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it were n't true . this is the stuff that disney movies are made of .|110010
the movie sticks much closer to hornby 's drop-dead confessional tone than the film version of high fidelity did .|26875
the movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short|149623
the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun|149629
the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial .|188458
the movie worked for me right up to the final scene , and|110014
the movie worked for me right up to the final scene , and then it caved in|110015
the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker .|188460
the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she 's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and|188471
the nicest thing that can be said about stealing harvard|149643
the niftiest trick perpetrated by the importance of being earnest|188475
the noble tradition of men in drag|149647
the obligatory break-ups and hook-ups do n't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters .|188482
the only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering . average , at best , i 'm afraid .|149660
the only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow .|188494
the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies ' underwear .|110050
the only thing '' swept away|149662
the only thing '' swept away '' is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time .|149663
the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are|149669
the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team .|149670
the origin story is well told , and|188507
the otherwise good-naturedness of mr. deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less - than-likely new york celebrities|226404
the overall fabric is hypnotic , and mr. mattei fosters moments of spontaneous intimacy .|226408
the pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie 's final scenes|149703
the pairing does sound promising in theory|188526
the party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks .|110067
the performances are so leaden ,|149713
the performances are so leaden , michael rymer 's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud .|149717
the picture , scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordion\/harmonica\/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety .|149724
the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn .|149725
the pitch must have read like a discarded house beautiful spread .|47213
the plot has a number of holes|149734
the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of|149749
the premise is in extremely bad taste , and|149761
the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences .|149764
the premise of jason x is silly but strangely believable .|69850
the pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie . and diesel is n't the actor to save it|188566
the principals in this cast are all fine , but|41286
the principals in this cast are all fine , but bishop and stevenson are standouts .|19326
the problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay .|188571
the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr. desplechin is content to state it .|226444
the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there 's no saving the movie .|226448
the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau|188582
the punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one .|188596
the question hanging over the time machine|226455
the real star of this movie is the score , as in the songs translate well to film , and it 's really well directed .|110124
the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque .|226458
the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today 's hollywood .|110134
the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film is n't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .|149799
the scope of the silberstein family is large|226465
the scope of the silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives , full of strength , warmth and vitality . .|226468
the screenplay never lets us forget that bourne was once an amoral assassin just like the ones who are pursuing him|69878
the screenplay sabotages the movie 's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes|149805
the script 's snazzy dialogue establishes a realistic atmosphere that involves us in the unfolding crisis ,|110141
the script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and|188637
the script by vincent r . nebrida ... tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot .|110147
the script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that does n't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people .|110148
the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy .|110149
the script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks .|110150
the script is n't very good ;|149821
the self-serious equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , is n't much fun without the highs and lows|188661
the sequel is everything the original was not :|188664
the sight of the name bruce willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind -- maybe too much|188671
the slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat .|188681
the smash 'em - up , crash 'em - up , shoot 'em - up ending|188682
the sound of gunfire and cell phones|110168
the sound of gunfire and cell phones ringing .|226483
the soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too .|188690
the star who helped give a spark to `` chasing amy '' and `` changing lanes '' falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer 's new action film , `` the sum of all fears . ''|226486
the stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble .|69923
the story 's pathetic and the gags are puerile .|188697
the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you ca n't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on .|149858
the story gives ample opportunity for large-scale action and suspense , which director shekhar kapur supplies with tremendous skill .|110171
the story has some nice twists but the ending and some of the back-story is a little tired . the performances are all solid ; it merely lacks originality to make it a great movie .|69939
the story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin .|188710
the story is lacking any real emotional impact|188711
the story is predictable , the jokes are typical sandler fare ,|188717
the story is virtually impossible to follow here , but there 's a certain style and wit to the dialogue .|110180
the story line may be 127 years old|69945
the story line may be 127 years old ,|69946
the story line may be 127 years old , but el crimen del padre amaro ... could n't be more timely in its despairing vision of corruption within the catholic establishment|69948
the story of trouble every day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film ,|188726
the story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness .|110186
the story wraps back around on itself in the kind of elegant symmetry that 's rare in film today , but be warned :|41296
the storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and|69954
the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus ,|149884
the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean|149885
the stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny .|188735
the subtle strength of `` elling '' is that it never loses touch with the reality of the grim situation .|226508
the thing about guys like evans is this : you 're never quite sure where self-promotion ends and the truth begins . but as you watch the movie , you 're too interested to care|110202
the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just|110207
the thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes ( of which they 'll get plenty )|226515
the threat implied in the title pokémon 4ever is terrifying|226518
the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you 'll read anywhere .|149938
the tonal shifts are jolting ,|69996
the tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy .|149945
the town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial .|110214
the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden|110219
the type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the ( teen comedy ) genre a bad name .|188759
the unexpected thing is that its dying , in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia , is quite beautiful|47275
the unexplored story opportunities of `` punch-drunk love '' may have worked against the maker 's minimalist intent but it is an interesting exercise by talented writer\/director anderson .|226528
the vampire thriller blade ii starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun|226533
the vivid lead performances sustain interest and empathy|47285
the volatile dynamics of female friendship|47291
the whole damn thing is ripe for the jerry springer crowd . it 's all pretty cynical and condescending , too .|149986
the wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism , and ms . ramsay and her co-writer , liana dognini , have dramatized the alan warner novel , which itself felt like an answer to irvine welsh 's book trainspotting .|110266
the work of a filmmaker who has secrets buried at the heart of his story and knows how to take time revealing them . strange occurrences|47303
the year 's happiest surprise , a movie that deals with a real subject in an always surprising way .|14520
there 's ... an underlying old world sexism to monday morning that undercuts its charm .|70066
there 's a great deal of corny dialogue and preposterous moments . and|110279
there 's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long .|110292
there 's a vastness implied in metropolis that is just breathtaking .|19348
there 's absolutely no reason why blue crush , a late-summer surfer girl entry , should be as entertaining as it is|110294
there 's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent .|150040
there 's back-stabbing , inter-racial desire and , most importantly , singing and dancing .|47306
there 's much tongue in cheek in the film and there 's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all .|110304
there 's no clear picture of who killed bob crane . but here 's a glimpse at his life .|70073
there 's no denying that burns is a filmmaker with a bright future ahead of him .|110305
there 's no denying the elaborateness of the artist 's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity|150048
there 's no emotional pulse to solaris . with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh 's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff .|150051
there 's no getting around the fact that this is revenge of the nerds revisited -- again .|110311
there 's no question that epps scores once or twice , but it 's telling that his funniest moment comes when he falls about ten feet onto his head .|110323
there 's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant .|150061
there 's nothing exactly wrong here|188841
there 's nothing like love to give a movie a b-12 shot|70090
there 's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits .|188858
there 's suspension of disbelief and then there 's bad screenwriting ... this film packs a wallop of the latter .|150080
there 's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging|150084
there 's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .|188859
there are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores ,|188863
there are a few modest laughs|188867
there are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made a walk to remember a niche hit .|110343
there are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them|188873
there are n't many conclusive answers in the film , but|70119
there are n't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming ( without a thick shmear of the goo , at least )|226578
there are n't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming ( without a thick shmear of the goo , at least ) ,|226579
there are plenty of scenes in frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself .|188883
there are plot holes big enough for shamu the killer whale to swim through .|150090
there are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part sliding doors , part pop video --|150091
there are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer|110355
there are some laughs in this movie , but williams ' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak .|188888
there are times when a rumor of angels plays like an extended episode of touched by an angel -- a little too much dancing , a few too many weeping scenes -- but i liked its heart and its spirit .|26951
there are times when you wish that the movie had worked a little harder to conceal its contrivances ,|70130
there is a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work|47318
there is a refreshing absence of cynicism in stuart little 2|226593
there is a refreshing absence of cynicism in stuart little 2 -- quite a rarity , even in the family film market . eventually , it wins you over .|26958
there is n't one moment in the film that surprises or delights .|188893
there is no pleasure in watching a child suffer . just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame .|150114
there is nothing outstanding about this film ,|47326
there is very little dread or apprehension|150122
there must be an audience that enjoys the friday series , but i would n't be interested in knowing any of them personally .|110390
these characters are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field ,|70151
these self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and|188906
they just do n't work in concert|70163
they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who have n't read the book .|110399
they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering .|150139
they were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they 'd earn . they were right .|110401
things really get weird , though not particularly scary :|188932
this new zealand coming-of-age movie is n't really about anything .|226624
this amiable picture talks tough , but it 's all bluster -- in the end it 's as sweet as greenfingers ...|110428
this angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in ordinary people .|188957
this big screen caper has a good bark , far from being a bow-wow .|70175
this cinema verite speculation on the assassination of john f . kennedy may have been inspired by blair witch ,|70184
this cinema verite speculation on the assassination of john f . kennedy may have been inspired by blair witch , but|70185
this cinema verite speculation on the assassination of john f . kennedy may have been inspired by blair witch , but it takes its techniques into such fresh territory that the film never feels derivative|70186
this director 's cut -- which adds 51 minutes|188961
this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle|110434
this ecologically minded , wildlife friendly film|26976
this engrossing , characteristically complex tom clancy thriller|70188
this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .|150177
this fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air .|70193
this film is full of rabbits .|226639
this film is full of rabbits . brimful .|150187
this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it 's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay .|150191
this film puts wang at the forefront of china 's sixth generation of film makers .|70196
this is so de palma . if you love him , you 'll like it . if you do n't ... well , skip to another review .|70209
this is a good movie in spurts , but when it does n't work , it 's at important times|150213
this is a good script , good dialogue , funny even for adults . the characters are interesting and often very creatively constructed from figure to backstory .|47364
this is a more fascinating look at the future than `` bladerunner '' and one of the most high-concept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen .|226648
this is a movie full of grace and , ultimately , hope|110473
this is a movie that is what it is : a pleasant distraction , a friday night diversion , an excuse to eat popcorn .|226649
this is a nervy , risky film , and|110483
this is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humour and pathos .|70218
this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker|110488
this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but|110490
this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it|110491
this is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground .|70229
this is historical filmmaking without the balm of right-thinking ideology , either liberal or conservative .|226657
this is lightweight filmmaking , to be sure , but|70234
this is mostly well-constructed fluff , which is all it seems intended to be .|70238
this is n't a stand up and cheer flick ; it 's a sit down and ponder affair|226663
this is n't exactly profound cinema , but|70246
this is not an easy film . but it could be , by its art and heart , a necessary one .|70257
this is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences ... and|110503
this is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight ,|189021
this is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream .|189036
this is the kind of subject matter that could so easily have been fumbled by a lesser filmmaker , but|70265
this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and|150254
this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but|150259
this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away|150260
this long and relentlessly saccharine film|150265

this movie may not have the highest production values you 've ever seen|47380
this movie may not have the highest production values you 've ever seen , but it 's the work of an artist , one whose view of america , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep|47383
this new movie version of the alexandre dumas classic|70286
this often-hilarious farce manages to generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its high-minded appeal .|110536
this one is certainly well-meaning , but it 's also simple-minded and contrived .|150288
this overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary . hmmm ... might i suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener ?|110538
this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications|189067
this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications ...|189068
this pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but|150296
this picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer .|150300
this real-life hollywood fairy-tale is more engaging than the usual fantasies hollywood produces .|70310
this remake gets all there is to get out of a peculiar premise with promise : al pacino loathing robin williams .|47389
this riveting world war ii moral suspense story deals with the shadow side of american culture : racial prejudice in its ugly and diverse forms|47391
this seductive tease of a thriller gets the job done . it 's a scorcher .|110552
this series should have died long ago ,|150313
this time , the hype is quieter , and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first , it 's still a rollicking good time for the most part .|47403
this time kaufman 's imagination has failed him .|150318
this warm and gentle romantic comedy has enough interesting characters to fill several movies , and its ample charms should win over the most hard-hearted cynics|41348
this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes .|226718

though frodo 's quest remains unfulfilled , a hardy group of determined new zealanders has proved its creative mettle .|70344
though harris is affecting at times|189122
though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .|150346
though mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic|19369
though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .|189131

is even remotely new or interesting|202897
is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be .|202900
is every bit as fascinating as it is flawed .|84183

is it the kahlo movie frida fans have been looking for|203014
is its conclusion , when we hear the ultimate fate of these girls and realize , much to our dismay , that this really did happen .|232509
is its content , look , and style|124169
is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material|124170
is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map|124174
is just a little bit hard to love .|203025

is left with the inescapable conclusion that hitchens ' obsession with kissinger is , at bottom , a sophisticated flower child 's desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power|84346
is less like a children 's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts .|162996
is less poetic than simply pretentious|162997

is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant '' if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny '' syndrome|7766
is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema . he allows his cast members to make creative contributions to the story and dialogue . this method almost never fails him , and it works superbly here|53565
is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original|232691
is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that does n't know what it wants to be when it grows up|124402

is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew .|203304
is painfully bad , a fourth-rate jim carrey who does n't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb .|203313
is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what 's left of his passe ' chopsocky glory|203314
is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill|203318
is perfectly creepy and believable|124444
is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust-caked stagnation and labored gentility|163232
is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes|1392

is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live|21053
is shockingly devoid of your typical majid majidi shoe-loving , crippled children|84600
is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts does n't mean it 's good enough for our girls .|124486

is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do .|163414

is that there is no rest period , no timeout|124648
is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally .|124650
is that those responsible did n't cut their losses -- and ours -- and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home .|203534
is the alchemical transmogrification of wilde into austen -- and a hollywood-ized austen at that|203543
is the best little '' horror '' movie|124661
is the best little `` horror '' movie i 've seen in years .|232798

is the film equivalent of a lovingly rendered coffee table book|124678
is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes .|163454
is the kind of movie that 's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low|163461
is the kind of movie that deserves a chance to shine|84735
is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears ' first movie|203566
is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage|7807
is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time|163466
is the parade of veteran painters , confounded dealers , and miscellaneous bohos who expound upon the subject 's mysterious personality without ever explaining him|124690
is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies . this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer .|203572
is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice|84748
is the project 's prime mystery|203573
is the rare director who does not want to invite viewers to gawk at or applaud his special effects|21068
is the script 's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a '' cooler '' pg-13 rating|163481
is the sense that peace is possible .|84754
is the sheer , selfish , wound-licking , bar-scrapping doggedness of leon 's struggle to face and transmute his demons that makes the movie a spirited and touching occasion , despite its patchy construction .|53666
is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video -- with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes .|124700
is the stuff that disney movies are made of .|124703

is to be commended for its straight-ahead approach to creepiness|53676
is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle|53677
is to imply terror by suggestion , rather than the overuse of special effects .|84770
is to say it 's unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance|84771
is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum|84773
is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama .|232848

is well shot and very tragic|232874
is what george orwell might have imagined had today 's mood-altering drug therapy been envisioned by chemists in 1949 .|53704
is what has happened already to so many silent movies , newsreels and the like .|232881
is what it is -- a nice , harmless date film|232883
is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups|33559
is worth seeking out|21077
it 's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled ` the loud and the ludicrous '|7840
it 's a conundrum not worth solving .|203722
it 's a demented kitsch mess ( although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative ) , but it 's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year|1425
it 's a very entertaining , thought-provoking film with a simple message|84862
it 's a welcome return to the roots of a genre that should depend on surprises|16308
it 's a well-written and occasionally challenging social drama that actually has something interesting to say|84863
it 's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away|232925
it 's also a -- dare i say it twice -- delightfully charming -- and totally american , i might add -- slice of comedic bliss .|84866
it 's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly , unabashedly on its sleeve|124812
it 's an observant , unfussily poetic meditation about identity and alienation|124817
it 's better to go in knowing full well what 's going to happen , but willing to let the earnestness of its execution and skill of its cast take you down a familiar road with a few twists . cynics need not apply|53731

it 's cliche to call the film ` refreshing , ' but it is . ` drumline ' shows a level of young , black manhood that is funny , touching , smart and complicated|53742
it 's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking|1435
it 's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to '' tonight . ''|203755
it 's good enough to be the purr|84895
it 's hard not to be carried away|84898
it 's hard to figure the depth of these two literary figures , and even the times in which they lived . but they fascinate in their recklessness|84901
it 's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre .|232944
it 's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory|124834
it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest|232947
it 's lovely that cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life|124846
it 's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that 's ultimately rather inconsequential|163669
it 's not as obnoxious as tom green 's freddie got fingered|163670
it 's not quite the genre-busting film it 's been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe .|232956
it 's not very well shot or composed or edited|53756
it 's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch .|21093
it 's possible for a sequel to outshine the original|16321
it 's praises , but it 's definitely worth taking a look|84937
it 's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , and satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but|1447
it 's rare to find a film to which the adjective ` gentle ' applies|7889
it 's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards|7894
it 's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny .|1454
it 's sort of true and it 's sort of bogus and it 's ho-hum all the way through|163694
it 's still a rollicking good time for the most part|53762
it 's the kind of motion picture that wo n't make much of a splash when it 's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards|7901
it 's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages|163706
it 's there on the screen in their version of the quiet american|84951
it 's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge|232980
it 's too slowly paced to be a thriller|232985
it 's truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter ,|1460
it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years|203818
it 's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed|163712
it , offering fine acting moments and pungent|203821
it a step further , richer and deeper|124905
it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation|33618
it actually makes the heart soar|232989
it all or its stupidity or maybe even its inventiveness|84971
it all seems to be happening for the first time|7910
it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it 's like on the other side of the bra ? '|203844
it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead|203845
it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing .|232999
it can make him a problematic documentary subject|124932
it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success|84990
it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again|7921
it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon , anyway|124938
it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies|203857
it could never really have happened this way|203866
it creeped me out just fine .|33635
it does have a few cute moments|124957
it does n't even qualify as a spoof of such|124960
it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you .|163770
it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities|85023
it ends by blowing just about everything up|163778
it ends up being , like ( seinfeld 's ) revered tv show , about pretty much nothing .|163783
it ever been possible to say that williams has truly inhabited a character|21101
it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time .|21102
it feels more forced than usual .|124975
it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump|203902
it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten .|163799
it had just gone that one step further .|203911
it interesting trying to find out|1474
it intriguing , bizarre , dogma-like in spots - and quite truthful ,|53820
it is , it 's too long and unfocused|7946
it is a gripping , tidy little movie that takes mr. hill higher than he 's been in a while .|233035
it is a young artist 's thoughtful consideration of fatherhood|85056
it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited|203926
it is clearly a good thing .|53831
it is impossible not to be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times .|53837
it is impossible to care whether that boast is true|163833
it is in depicting child abuse|33670
it is more likely to induce sleep than fright .|125023
it is nonetheless -- and likely inadvertently -- a timely and invaluable implicit reminder of the role that u . s .|21112
it largely makes up for as loosey-goosey , experimental entertainment . still|33681
it looks an awful lot like life -- gritty , awkward and ironic|85085
it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target .|163857
it never quite adds up|203983
it never rises to its full potential as a film|85110
it one of the best war movies ever made|85113
it plainly has no business going|203990
it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing|163890
it progresses in such a low-key manner that it risks monotony|233080
it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time|125082
it seems better , not just bigger|53857
it seems like a minor miracle that its septuagenarian star is young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker 's son , more incredible|33704
it sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen .|233088
it serves as the antidote ( and cannier doppelganger ) to diesel 's xxx flex-a-thon|85127
it set out to lampoon , anyway|125097
it sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time|125098
it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows|163913
it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy .|204017
it stays in formula -- which is a waste of de niro , mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast|125102
it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman|204027
it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy|163926
it takes to describe how bad it is|125112
it taps into genuine artistic befuddlement , and at the same time presents a scathing indictment of what drives hollywood .|33720
it the kahlo movie frida fans have been looking for|204034
it tries to make us jump out of our seats|163934
it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood 's dirty harry period|204042
it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich|163938
it wants to be a mystery\/thriller , a romance or a comedy|163943
it was , as my friend david cross would call it , ` hungry-man portions of bad '|125133
it was intended to be a different kind of film|204061
it wears its b-movie heritage like a badge of honor|16359
it will just as likely make you weep|53880
it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear|163962
it wo n't be long before you 'll spy i spy at a video store near you|7982
it would be impossible to believe if it were n't true|125156
it would n't exist without the precedent of yiddish theater , whose jolly , fun-for-fun 's - sake communal spirit goes to the essence of broadway|233115
it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program|163971
its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework|233118
its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting|233119

its affectionate depiction of the gentle war between a reluctant , irresponsible man and the kid who latches onto him|85190
its aspiration to be a true ` epic '|125173

its fans are hoping it will be , and in that sense is a movie that deserves recommendation|85255
its flaws , fulfills one facet of its mission in making me want to find out whether , in this case , that 's true|85265
its heart is in the right place ... innocent and well-meaning|16379
its impact is all the greater beause director zhang 's last film , the cuddly shower , was a non-threatening multi-character piece centered around a public bath house|53937
its insanely staged ballroom scene , in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia|125277
its intermittent unease , reaffirming that long-held illusions are indeed reality , and that erasing them recasts the self|16382
its kind since ` brazil . ' lucas , take notes . this|21144
its laughs from stock redneck ` types ' and from the many , many moments when we recognize even without the elizabethan prose , the play behind the thing|33792
its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed ` surprises|204230
its macabre , self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot .|33797
its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm|125296
its makers are n't removed and inquisitive enough for that|204238
its message of christian love and compassion|164082
its most delightful moments come when various characters express their quirky inner selves|85313
its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma 's scarface . that 's a cheat|164084
its not very informative about its titular character and|204252
its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters|8089
its own droll and delicate little film|33816
its own staggeringly unoriginal terms|85345
its profound self-evaluation message about our fragile existence and the absence of spiritual guidance should at least invade an abundance of mindsets|33831
its protagonist , after being an object of intense scrutiny for 104 minutes , remains a complete blank|204296
its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations|204303
its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time|8136
its shortcomings are remembered only as an afterthought|33853
its soccer action and its fine acting|33856
its soul 's - eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice , at least as represented by this case|85397
its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity|233172
its star , jean reno , who resembles sly stallone in a hot sake half-sleep|53991
its steadfast refusal to set up a dualistic battle between good and evil|125371
its stupidities wind up sticking in one 's mind a lot more than the cool bits .|125375
its subject a movie worthy of his talents|33861
its target audience of urban kids|16399
its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life|125395
